## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Python 3.6 (should probably be upped)

Something about hardware requirements here

### Installation

After cloning the repo into a new directory, make a virtual environment, activate it, and install the dependencies, e.g.

```
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements_dev.txt
```

Once finished   

```
deactivate
```

### Running Tests

#### Linting
This library uses `flake8` for linting. Please identify formatting errors in your code **before** pushing by running the following 

```
flake8 path/to/file/to/test
```

## Usage

The script `example.py` provides an example workflow for using PackageName.
