## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Python 3.8 - 3.10  

*We highly recommand that uses the version between 3.8 and 3.10. With these versions, dependencies can be installed properly.


### Installation

After cloning the repo into a new directory, make a virtual environment called 'venv', activate it, and install the dependencies using pip tool, e.g.

```
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Note: the requirements file contains all the dependencies needed, and it works well when the version of python is in the mentioned range.**

Once finished   

```
deactivate
```

### Running Tests

#### Linting
This library uses `flake8` for linting. Please identify formatting errors in your code **before** pushing by running the following 

```
flake8 path/to/file/to/test
```

## Usage

The script `example.py` provides an example workflow for using PackageName.
